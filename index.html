      <h1>What are Uromastyx?</h1>
      <p class="lead">Understanding your new scaley friend.</p>
      <p>Uromastyx are desert dwelling lizards who have just recently entered the lizard pet scene. This means that you'll have a harder time finding a Uromatyx for sale rather than a Bearded Dragon. Uromastyx can cost between $100 to $500 if you are looking for a rare breed. Other names of these include Uromastyx Geyri or Spiny Tailed Lizards. Uromastyx generally live in extremely warm temperatures and survive off of a plant based diet. This means that caring for uromastyx is simpler than other lizards as unlike other lizards you do not have to feed bugs or rodents.</p>

      <h1>The Diet of a Uromastyx</h1>
      <p class="lead">What to feed to your uromastyx.</p>
      <p>Uromastyx often eat dark greens such as the leaves of Romaine, Cilantro, Escarole, Kale, Turnip, and Dandilions. They also love the taste of fruit such as apple and grapes, but these fruits are high in calcium and therefore should never make up more than 10% of their diet. Uromastyx also require reptile supplement powders which should be spread on their food twice weekly to give them a healthy boost in vitamins. Insects could also be fed but from personal experience it should remain a rare treat. Food for your uromastyx should be cut into pieces smaller or bigger depending on the lizard's age. Uromastyx do not need water to survive.</p>

      <h1>Befriending your Uromastyx</h1>
      <p class="lead">How to gain trust and build friendship with your Uromastyx.</p>
      <p>This part is a bit tricky, your Uromastyx may be less or more friendly depending on if they are wild caught or home bred. Wild caught Uromastyx are generally more aggressive, they may spend more time hiding and take more time to adjust to the your home. This is because they are caught directly from the wild and has never been in an enclosure, this means they usually go for cheap prices. However home bred Uromastyx are different in that they have been bred in enclosures. This means it will take less time for a home bred Uromastyx to settle in. Home breds may take around 2 weeks to a month while wild caughts may take upwards to 6 months. </p>

      <h1>Buying your Uromastyx</h1>
      <p class="lead">There are a lot of factors to consider when purchasing a Uromastyx.</p>
      <p>From the previous section you might think that home bred Uromastyx are generally amazing, however when buying a Uromastyx you might discover that home bred sellers are extremely rare. A safe assumption from looking at data tells us that only 5% of all Uromastyx sold is home bred. Some sellers may even claim their Uromastyx are home bred to boost their prices and sales. This behaviour fro sellers isn't limited to Uromastyx but other lizards as well. It's also important to know the gender of your Uromastyx if you are getting multiple, sellers will usually tell you but female Uromastyx will be less colorful than males and males also have buldges above their anus. </p>

      <h1>Uromastyx Species</h1>
      <p class="lead">What type of Uromastyx should you buy?</p>
      <p>But when buying a Uromastyx you also have to consider what breed of uromastyx you want, I will be going over the most popular breeds. The two breeds you'll encounter most often are Yellow and Red Niger Uromastyx. It's important to know that Uromastyx always start off as a grey and black color, but begin to gain vibrant colors with age. Two breeds which are popular but much rarer are Egyptian and Ornate breeds. Egypitan Uromastyx are the largest breed growing twice as big as a Yellow Niger. They have a drab, greyish tan color. Ornate Uromastyx are by far the most colorful. Ornates are results of breeding different kinds of Uromastyx. Ornates have greenish-blue skin and orange or yellow streaks. </p>
